Custom dimensions can be defined using the @dim macro.\n\nWe can use dim wrappers for indexing, so that the dimension order in the underlying array does not need to be known:\n\njulia> using DimensionalData\n\njulia> A = DimArray(rand(40, 50), (X, Y));\n\njulia> A[Y(1), X(1:10)]\nDimArray with dimensions:\n X: 1:10 (NoIndex)\nand referenced dimensions:\n Y: 1 (NoIndex)\nand data: 10-element Array{Float64,1}\n[0.515774, 0.575247, 0.429075, 0.234041, 0.4484, 0.302562, 0.911098, 0.541537, 0.267234, 0.370663]\n\nAnd this has no runtime cost:\n\njulia> using BenchmarkTools\n\njulia> @btime A[X(1), Y(2)]\n  25.068 ns (1 allocation: 16 bytes)\n0.7302366320496405\n\njulia> @btime parent(A)[1, 2]\n  34.061 ns (1 allocation: 16 bytes)\n0.7302366320496405\n\nThe core component is the Dimension, and types that inherit from it, such as Time, X, Y, Z, the generic Dim{:x} or others you define manually using the @dim macro.\n\nDims can be used for indexing and views without knowing dimension order:\n\nA[X(10)]\nview(A, Y(30:40), X(1:20))\n\nAnd for indicating dimensions to reduce or permute in julia Base and Statistics functions that have dims arguments:\n\nusing Statistics\n\nA = DimArray(rand(10, 10, 100), (X, Y, Ti));\nmean(A, dims=Ti)\npermutedims(A, [Ti, Y, X])\n\nYou can also use arbitrary symbol to create Dim{X} dimensions:\n\njulia> A = DimArray(rand(10, 20, 30), (:a, :b, :c));\n\njulia> A[a=2:5, c=9]\n\nDimArray with dimensions:\n Dim{:a}: 2:5 (NoIndex)\n Dim{:b}: Base.OneTo(20) (NoIndex)\nand referenced dimensions:\n Dim{:c}: 9 (NoIndex)\nand data: 4×20 Array{Float64,2}\n 0.868237   0.528297   0.32389   …  0.89322   0.6776    0.604891\n 0.635544   0.0526766  0.965727     0.50829   0.661853  0.410173\n 0.732377   0.990363   0.728461     0.610426  0.283663  0.00224321\n 0.0849853  0.554705   0.594263     0.217618  0.198165  0.661853\n\nOther methods also work:\n\njulia> bounds(A, (:b, :c))\n\n((1, 20), (1, 30))\n\njulia> mean(A, dim=Dim{:b})\n\njulia> mean(A, dims=Dim{:b})\nDimArray with dimensions:\n Dim{:a}: Base.OneTo(10) (NoIndex)\n Dim{:b}: 1 (NoIndex)\n Dim{:c}: Base.OneTo(30) (NoIndex)\nand data: 10×1×30 Array{Float64,3}\n[:, :, 1]\n 0.543099\n 0.542407\n 0.540647\n 0.513554\n 0.601689\n 0.601558\n 0.46997\n 0.524254\n 0.601844\n 0.520966\n[and 29 more slices...]\n\nSelectors\n\nSelectors find indices in the dimension based on values At, Near, or Between the index value(s). They can be used in getindex, setindex! and view to select indices matching the passed in value(s)\n\nAt(x): get indices exactly matching the passed in value(s)\nNear(x): get the closest indices to the passed in value(s)\nWhere(f::Function): filter the array axis by a function of dimension index values.\nBetween(a, b): get all indices between two values (inclusive)\nContains(x): get indices where the value x falls in the interval. Only used for Sampled Intervals, for Points us At.\n\nWe can use selectors with dim wrappers:\n\nA[X(Between(1, 10)), Y(At(25.7))]\n\nWithout dim wrappers selectors must be in the right order:\n\nusing Unitful\n\njulia> A = DimArray(rand(10, 20), (X((1:10:100)u\"m\"), Ti((1:5:100)u\"s\")))\n\njulia> A[Between(10.5u\"m\", 50.5u\"m\"), Near(23u\"s\")]\nDimArray with dimensions:\n X: (11:10:41) m (Sampled: Ordered Regular Points)\nand referenced dimensions:\n Time (type Ti): 21 s (Sampled: Ordered Regular Points)\nand data: 4-element Array{Float64,1}\n[0.819172, 0.418113, 0.461722, 0.379877]\n\nFor values other than Int/AbstractArray/Colon (which are set aside for regular indexing) the At selector is assumed, and can be dropped completely:\n\njulia> A = DimArray(rand(3, 3), (X(Val((:a, :b, :c))), Y([25.6, 25.7, 25.8])))\nDimArray with dimensions:\n X: Val{(:a, :b, :c)}()\n Y: Float64[25.6, 25.7, 25.8]\nand data: 3×3 Array{Float64,2}\n 0.280308  0.92255    0.023938\n 0.129487  0.0993857  0.618391\n 0.246378  0.276186   0.0425624\n\njulia> A[:b, 25.8]\n0.61839141062599\n\nUsing all Val indexes (only recommended for small arrays) you can index with named dimensions At arbitrary values with no runtime cost:\n\nusing BenchmarkTools\n\njulia> A = DimArray(rand(3, 3), (cat=Val((:a, :b, :c)),\n                                 val=Val((5.0, 6.0, 7.0))))\nDimArray with dimensions:\n Dim{:cat}: Val{(:a, :b, :c)}() (Categorical: Unordered)\n Dim{:val}: Val{(5.0, 6.0, 7.0)}() (Categorical: Unordered)\nand data: 3×3 Array{Float64,2}\n 0.993357  0.765515  0.914423\n 0.405196  0.98223   0.330779\n 0.365312  0.388873  0.88732\n\njulia> @btime A[:a, 7.0]\n  26.333 ns (1 allocation: 16 bytes)\n0.32927504968939925\n\njulia> @btime A[cat=:a, val=7.0]\n  31.920 ns (2 allocations: 48 bytes)\n0.7476441117572306\n\nIt's also easy to write your own custom Selector if your need a different behaviour.\n\nExample usage:\n\nusing Dates, DimensionalData\ntimespan = DateTime(2001,1):Month(1):DateTime(2001,12)\nA = DimArray(rand(12,10), (Ti(timespan), X(10:10:100)))\n\njulia> A[X(Near(35)), Ti(At(DateTime(2001,5)))]\n0.658404535807791\n\njulia> A[Near(DateTime(2001, 5, 4)), Between(20, 50)]\nDimArray with dimensions:\n X: 20:10:50\nand referenced dimensions:\n Time (type Ti): 2001-05-01T00:00:00\nand data: 4-element Array{Float64,1}\n[0.456175, 0.737336, 0.658405, 0.520152]\n\nDim types or objects can be used instead of a dimension number in many Base and Statistics methods:\n\nMethods where dims can be used containing indices or Selectors\n\ngetindex, setindex! view\n\nMethods where dims can be used\n\nsize, axes, firstindex, lastindex\ncat\nreverse\ndropdims\nreduce, mapreduce\nsum, prod, maximum, minimum,\nmean, median, extrema, std, var, cor, cov\npermutedims, adjoint, transpose, Transpose\nmapslices, eachslice\nfill\n\nExample usage:\n\nA = DimArray(rand(20,10), (X, Y))\nsize(A, Y)\nusing Statistics\nmean(A, dims=X)\nstd(A; dims=Y())\n\nAlternate Packages\n\nThere are a lot of similar Julia packages in this space. AxisArrays.jl, NamedDims.jl, NamedArrays.jl are registered alternative that each cover some of the functionality provided by DimensionalData.jl. DimensionalData.jl should be able to replicate any of their functionality, although with slightly more verbose syntax and less polish in some cases. If there is anything it doesn't do that these packages can do, put in an issue with the feature request.\n\nAxisRanges.jl and AbstractIndices.jl are some other interesting developments. For more detail on why there are so many similar options and where things are headed, read this thread.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"}]
